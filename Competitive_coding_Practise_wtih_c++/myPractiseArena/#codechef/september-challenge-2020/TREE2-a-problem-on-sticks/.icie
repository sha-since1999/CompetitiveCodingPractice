Suddenly, Akbar noticed a bunch of sticks on the ground and decided to test Birbal's wits.</p>\n<p>There are $N$ stick holders with negligible size (numbered $1$ through $N$) in a row on the ground. Akbar places all the sticks in them vertically; for each valid $i$, the initial height of the stick in the $i$-th holder is $A_i$. Birbal has a stick cutter and his task is to completely cut all these sticks, i.e. reduce the heights of all sticks to $0$. He may perform zero or more operations; in each operation, he should do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Choose an integer $H$ and fix the cutter at the height $H$ above the ground.</li>\n<li>The cutter moves from the $1$-st to the $N$-th stick holder. Whenever it encounters a stick whose current height is greater than $H$, it cuts this stick down to height $H$ (i.e. for a stick with height $h \\gt H$, it removes its upper part with length $h-H$).</li>\n<li>All the upper parts of sticks that are cut in one operation must have equal lengths. Otherwise, the operation may not be performed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example, if the heights of sticks are initially $[5, 3, 5]$, then some valid values for $H$ in the first operation are $3$ and $4$ ― the cutter cuts the upper parts of two sticks and their lengths are $[2, 2]$ and $[1, 1]$ respectively. $H = 2$ is an invalid choice because it would cut the upper parts of all three sticks with lengths $[3, 1, 3]$, which are not all equal.</p>\n<p>Akbar wants Birbal to completely cut all sticks in the minimum possible number of operations. If you want to be friends with Birbal, help him solve the problem.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases.
