This strip is described by a sequence $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$, where for each valid $i$, the $i$-th cell is blocked if $A_i = 1$ or free if $A_i = 0$. Tzuyu and Nayeon are going to use it to play a game with the following rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The players alternate turns; Nayeon plays first.</li>\n<li>Initially, both players are outside of the strip. However, note that afterwards during the game, their positions are always different.</li>\n<li>In each turn, the current player should choose a free cell and move there. Afterwards, this cell becomes blocked and the players cannot move to it again.</li>\n<li>If it is the current player's first turn, she may move to any free cell.</li>\n<li>Otherwise, she may only move to one of the left and right adjacent cells, i.e. from a cell $c$, the current player may only move to the cell $c-1$ or $c+1$ (if it is free).</li>\n<li>If a player is unable to move to a free cell during her turn, this player loses the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nayeon and Tzuyu are very smart, so they both play optimally. Since it is Nayeon's birthday, she wants to know if she can beat Tzuyu. Find out who wins.</p>\n<h3>Input</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$.</li>\n<li>The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>For each test case, print a single line containing the string <code>&quot;Yes&quot;</code> if Nayeon wins the game or <code>&quot;No&quot;</code> if Tzuyu wins (without quotes).</p>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\le T \\le 40,000$</li>\n<li>$2 \\le N \\le 3\\cdot 10^5$</li>\n<li>$0 \\le A_i \\le 1$ for each valid $i$</li>\n<li>$A_1 = A_N = 1$</li>\n<li>the sum of $N$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<p><strong>Subtask #1 (50 points):</strong> $A_i = 0$ for each $i$ ($2 \\le i \\le N-1$)</p>\n<p><strong>Subtask #2 (50 points):</strong> original constraints</p>\n<h3>Example Input</h3>\n<pre><code>4\n7\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1\n8\n1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1\n4\n1 1 0 1\n4\n1 1 1 1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Example Output</h3>\n<pre><code>Yes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation</h3>\n<p><strong>Example case 1:</strong> Since both Nayeon and Tzuyu play optimally, Nayeon can start e.g. by moving to cell $4$, which then becomes blocked. Tzuyu has to pick either the cell $3$ or the cell $5$, which also becomes blocked. Nayeon is then left with only one empty cell next to cell $4$ (the one Tzuyu did not pick); after she moves there, Tzuyu is unable to move, so she loses the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Example case 2:</strong> Regardless of what cell Nayeon moves to at the start, Tzuyu will always be able to beat her.</p>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
