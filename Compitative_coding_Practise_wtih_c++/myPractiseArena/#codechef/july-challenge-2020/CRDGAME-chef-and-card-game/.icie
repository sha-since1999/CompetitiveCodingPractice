Pile $A$ belongs to Chef and pile $B$ belongs to Morty.</li>\n<li>Each card has one positive integer on it</li>\n<li>The ‘power’ of a card is defined as the sum of digits of the integer on that card</li>\n<li>The game consists of $N$ rounds</li>\n<li>In each round, both players simultaneously draw one card each from the top of their piles and the player who draws the card with higher power wins this round and gets a point. If the powers of both players' cards are equal then they get $1$ point each. </li>\n<li>The winner of the game is the player who has more points at the end of $N$ rounds. If both players have equal number of points then the game ends in a draw.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The game is now over and Chef has told Morty to find the winner. Unfortunately, this task is too complex for him. Help Morty find the winner. </p>\n<h3>Input:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>First line will contain $T$, number of testcases.</li>\n<li>The first line of each test case will contain $N$, the number of rounds played.</li>\n<li>The $i^{th}$ of the next $N$ lines of each test case will contain $A_i$ and $B_i$, the number on the card drawn by Chef and Morty respectively in round $i$.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Output:</h3>\n<p>For each test case, output two space separated integers on a new line:<br />\nOutput</p>\n<ul>\n<li>$0$ if Chef wins,</li>\n<li>$1$ if Morty wins,</li>\n<li>$2$ if it is a draw,<br />\nfollowed by the number of points the winner had.<br />\n(If it is a draw then output either player’s points).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Constraints</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$1 \\leq T \\leq 1000$</li>\n<li>$1 \\leq N \\leq 100$</li>\n<li>$1 \\leq A_i, B_i \\leq 10^9$</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Subtasks</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>$100$ points : No additional constraints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Sample Input:</h3>\n<pre><code>2\n3\n10 4\n8 12\n7 6\n2\n5 10\n3 4\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample Output:</h3>\n<pre><code>0 2\n2 1\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Explanation:</h3>\n<p><strong>Test Case</strong> $1$:</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong> $1$: </p>\n<p>Chef’s card has power $1+0$ = $1$,<br />\nMorty’s card has power $4$.<br />\nTherefore, Morty wins the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong> $2$: </p>\n<p>Chef’s card has power $8$,<br />\nMorty’s card has power $1 + 2$ = $3$.<br />\nTherefore, Chef wins the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong> $3$: </p>\n<p>Chef’s card has power $7$,<br />\nMorty’s card has power $6$.<br />\nTherefore, Chef wins the round.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Chef wins the game with $2$ points (Morty has $1$ point).</p>\n<p><strong>Test Case</strong> $2$:</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong> $1$: </p>\n<p>Chef’s card has power $5$,<br />\nMorty’s card has power $1 + 0 = 1$.<br />\nTherefore, Chef wins the round.</p>\n<p><strong>Round</strong> $2$: </p>\n<p>Chef’s card has power $3$,<br />\nMorty’s card has power $4$.<br />\nTherefore, Morty wins the round.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the game ends in a draw and both players have $1$ point each.</p>\n\n\t<body>\n</html>"}}}
